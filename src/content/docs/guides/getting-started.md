Getting started at Meiro involves a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, learning the details of your new job, meeting new coworkers, all while working remotely. Your teammates, your manager, your Meiro buddy, your Ops buddy, and our People team are all here to help as you navigate your first few days and weeks.

## Your First Few Days

A day or two before you start, your manager will email you instructions for your first day. Your manager will be your point of contact for your early projects and activities. You’ll also work with a member of our Ops team who will help you as you set up all the accounts you need to work at Meiro.

On your first day, you’ll log into [Meiro Notion](https://www.notion.so/e49dea49d90c4b3dbdedd35ead4c3898?v=2c0e56ff9b914b1b8210904d3e577272) to see an onboarding card under your name. Your welcome project will contain a few to-do lists, tailored to your role and linking to accounts or services that you need to set up. You’ll also see to-do lists that your Ops buddy and manager will be working through. Your Ops buddy and your manager will be in contact with you as you set up your environment, should you have questions or get stuck.

Your welcome project will also contain a list of people to meet over the course of your first few weeks.

* Your manager. You and your manager will meet on your first day to sort out a recurring 1:1 schedule and to review your specific onboarding expectations.
* Your team. Most teams have a weekly call which you’ll join your first week.
* Your Meiro buddy. Your buddy will be someone who’s not on your immediate team, who’s worked at Meiro for a while, and who can point you in the right direction when you have a question and don’t quite know where to turn. They’ll introduce themselves during your first week, to say hi and offer their help. They’ll check in with you periodically throughout your first couple months to see how you’re settling in.
* People Ops. You’ll meet with Martina to review Meiro policies, benefits, and compensation.

After your environment has been set up, expectations are clear, and you’ve met who you need to meet, you’ll get to work! You’ll begin working on real projects, with plenty of support and guidance, within your first week. Your responsibilities and impact will increase as you learn and gain confidence over the next few months, and most people are up to speed and feeling fully part of the team in about 3 months.
